The aim of the game is to hit the black balls with bullet, and prevent it from getting inside any of the bucket.
Pocketing green and red cubes in the bucket leads to 5 points, while hitting the black cubes with bullet gives
3 points. The canon can be controlled by keyboard controls as described in the assignment doc(pdf). Same goes
with the buckets. There is a scoring system that outputs the score on the terminal after the end of the game.
